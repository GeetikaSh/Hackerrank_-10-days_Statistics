In this question we are asked to find the probability of defect occuring within first 5 inspections i.e.e P(X<=5)
P(X<=5)= P(X=1)+P(X=2)+P(X=3)+P(X=4)+P(X=5)
       = 1- (P(first five inspections are all failure))
       = 1 -(q^5)
where q=1-p = probability of product to me flawless
'''
p=1/3
q=1-p
p1=q**5
prob=1-p1
print(round(prob,3))
