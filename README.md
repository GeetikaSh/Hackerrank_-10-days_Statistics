**Poisson Distribution(Count Distribution)**
> It is used to show how many times an event is likely to occur over a specified period
Poisson distributions are often used to understand independent events that occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time. It was named after French mathematician SimÃ©on Denis Poisson.

> The Poisson distribution is a discrete function, meaning the variable can only take the values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., with no fractions or decimals.

Many economic and financial data appear as count variables, such as how many times a person becomes unemployed in a given year, thus lending itself to analysis with a Poisson distribution.
